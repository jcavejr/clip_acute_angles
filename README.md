# clipe_acute_angles

This project was worked on under Dr. Suneeta Ramaswami with Andre Smith and Dominic Scolla at Rutgers University in Camden.

The goal of this project was to be able to remove acute angles from any polygon (in .poly or .poly/.node form) too allow Dr. Suneeta Ramaswami to test lsup.poly (lake superior) with her quadrangulation algorithm.

This repository does not contain the full clipping program, only the parts I personally worked on.
